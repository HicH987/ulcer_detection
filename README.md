# Ulcer detection
## Description
ulcer detection in endoscopy videos using color segmentation with HSV
using python's librarys:
-   **numpy**
-   **openCV**
-   **matplotlib**: to disply figures in nooebook
-   **scipy.ndimage**: for 3D median
-   **skimage.color**: for rgb2hsv
-   **skimage.morphology**: for disk structured element

## Features

<h3>Top-Hat filtre</h3>
<p>The top-hat filter is used to enhance bright objects of interest in a dark background</p>

<h3>Bottom(black)-Hat filtre</h3>
<p>Bottom-Hat filter is used to do the opposite of top-hat, enhance dark objects of interest in a bright background</p>

<h3>Combine top-bottom with image</h3>
<p>
    It is possible to add the bright areas to the image and subtract the dark areas from it. <br>As a result, there will be an enhancement in the contrast between bright and dark areas: <br>
    <strong>  I(contrast enhanced) = I + topHat(I) - bottomHat(I) </strong> 
</p>

<h3>Applicated Median filter</h3>
<p>
    3D median filter is applied to remove the salt and pepper noise, and improve the image from extra noise
</p>

<h3>Applicated HSV filter</h3>
<p>
    In the RGB representation the hue and the luminosity are expressed as a linear combination of the R,G,B channels, whereas they correspond to single channels of the HSV image (the Hue and the Value channels). A simple segmentation of the image can then be effectively performed by a mere thresholding of the HSV channels.

<h3>Set a threshold on the Hue channel</h3>
<p>notice that we first defined a lower and upper mask for the intended object. The value of the mask is derived from the color bar value at the side of the Hue Graph. Notice that the <strong>ulcer</strong> has a hue that is really different from the background.</p>

<h3>Segment RGB to Gray</h3>
<p>Convert the segment to grayscale to apply morphological filters to it</p>

<h3>Apply Morphological filters</h3>
<p>enhance segment with morphologic filters</p>

<h3>Overlay segmented image on top of main image</h3>
<p>Display the contour of the detected segment (ulcer) by superimposing the original image with segment after morphological enhancement</p>

## Deployment
-   all videos are in [ulcer_detection/tree/main/dataset/videos]
-   each video has the name "Endpscopy_<number of the video>.mp4"
-   <number of the video> âˆˆ [0,4]

To launch the detection on a video, open your favorite Terminal and run this commands:
```sh
python detection_on_video.py <number of the video>
```
